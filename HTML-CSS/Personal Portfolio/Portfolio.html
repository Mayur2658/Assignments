            <h2> About Mayur</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently in my final year studying electronics and communication
                engineering in India. I've come to no that, ECE is not something of my taste. I found my true purpose in
                programming: seeing how lines of code can instruct comptuers to do great things truely intriqued me. S o
                I am currently in a journey to become the most profiecient programmer there ever lived. Follow me and my
                work. Hire me, I will work for free.My passion is to use technology based solutions, to help solve real
                world challenges. </P>

                <h2>Cell Phone Operated Land Rover</h2>
                <p>Traditionally, wireless controlled robots make use of RF (radio frequency) circuits, which have their disadvantages of restricted operational range, limited frequency range, and limited control. This project introduces the use of the mobile phone for robotic control.  This technology is more controller friendly as it doesnâ€™t interfere with other controllers and can use up to twelve controls.  It also has the advantages of robust control and provides working range as large as the coverage area of the service provider. Although the look and capabilities of these robots vary, they share mechanically movable structures under some form of control.

                <h2>RFID Based Door Access Control</h2>
                <p>The conception of entrance control is brought about by the mean of a card, a parallel card reader, and a control board that is amalgamated with the server. This is a proximity card with a unique ID number incorporated in it. The card reader interprets the data and sends it to the control board, which is a microcontroller. This microcontroller tests the legality of the data with the incorporated server, which abides the database. The attached server is uploaded with the details of the worker for that unique ID number.</p>
