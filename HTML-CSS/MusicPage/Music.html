        <h2>A world of entertainment. Available wherever you are.</h2>
        <p>
            Beautiful music is the art of the prophets that can calm the agitations of the soul; it is one of the most
            magnificent and delightful presents God has given us.
            People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some
            sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands -
            literally thousands - of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.”
            ― Nick Hornby, High Fidelity
